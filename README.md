# CETM67_ASSIGNMENT_TWO

This GitHub Repository is to show the required documents for CETM67 Software Platforms, Infrastructure & Deployment.

This includes:
 - 2 lambda functions in the BusinessQueries and Authenticator Directories.
 - a requirements file showing what is required to build, lint and test the code.
 - 1 yaml file to process the work flow on push new files to the repository. 
   This will proceed to lint and unit test the lambda functions and if succesful zip and upload these to my S3 bucket. This is in .github/workflows.
  
Thanks

Sean
